1:  Q:  With my compiler, errors appear. Why?
    A:  Try defining YCT_DISABLE_WCHAR and/or modify YCT_FUNC_NAME macro.

    2q: Q: In MS-DOS, linking fails. Why?
    2a: A: Allow more segments for code (medium or large memory model).

2:  Q:  I can compile/link, but generated executable is very big. Why?
    A:  yaCut is macro based. If you can, avoid log by defining the macro
        YCT_OPT_DISABLE_LOG. yaCut cannot do anything else. You can always
        enable space optimizations in your compiler and strip symbols.
        Last thing is to compress your executable file.
        Splitting your code in multiple smaller files may help.

3:  Q:  Which version to choose?
    A:  Release packages are quite tested and stable. Branches contain bugfix,
        improvements and new features, but may not be stable, not fully tested
        or may even fail to compile.
