1:  Q:  gcc -ansi gives errors. Why?
    A:  yaCut relies on C99. Replace -ansi with -std=c99 (or equivalent switch
        in your compiler).

2:  Q:  In MS-DOS, compilation errors that are absent in more recent OS appear.
        Why?
    A:  Try defining YCT_OPT_DISABLE_INT64. If still not resolved, look at
        YCT_FUNC_NAME macro.

    2q: Q: In MS-DOS, cannot link. Why?
    2a: A: Allow more segments for code (medium or large memory model).

3:  Q:  I can compile/link, but generated executable is very big. Why?
    A:  yaCut is macro based. If you can, avoid log, by defining the macro
        YCT_OPT_DISABLE_LOG. The macro YCT_OPT_DISABLE_TIMING just save some
        bytes. yaCut cannot do anything else. You can always instruct your
        compiler to enable space optimizations and strip symbols.
        Last thing is to pack your exe.
        Splitting your code in several smaller files may help.

4:  Q:  Which version to choose?
    A:  Release packages are quite tested and stable. Branches contain bugfix,
        improvements and new features, but may not be stable, not fully tested
        or may even fail to compile.
